# Neural Network (Python)

## Setting Up the Environment

To create the same environment with Python 3.7.7, NumPy 1.18.2, and Matplotlib 3.2.1, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thiunuwan/NeuralNetwork_Python.git
   cd NeuralNetwork_Python
    ```

2. Create the conda environment from the environment.yml file:
    ```bash
    conda env create -f environment.yml
    ```

3. Activate the environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate nn_scratch  
    ```

This will install the specified versions of Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib, along with any other dependencies.
